Description: GeoLift is an end-to-end solution to measure lift at 
    a geographical level. It is a flexible and robust implementation
    of Augmented Generalized Synthetic Controls. The package
    provides tools to perform power calculations to plan future 
    studies, market selection,  as well as inference to calculate 
    the lift of a study. GeoLift allows for flexible geo-grain 
    definitions but is recommended for geographic aggregation levels 
    of cities or higher for daily or weekly data. 
    To run a GeoLift experiment at least 25 pre-treatment
    periods and over 20 geo-units are recommended.
