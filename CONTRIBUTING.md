# Contributing to GeoLift

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

GeoLift was built as an end-to-end solution to measure Lift at a geo-level using
Synthetic Control Methods (SCMs). Through GeoLift it is possible to design and set-up new
geo-experiments through the Power Calculator/Market Selection pieces as well
as to measure the incremental effect (Lift) that a treatment had on a set of test geos.
We are offering this solution as an easy-to-use and transparent way to understand the 
true value of a marketing campaign, measure omni-channel incrementality, contrast 
cross-channel efficiencies, and optimize marketing strategies.
